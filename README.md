# 👋 Hi, I'm Eli  

I’m a Master’s student in **Computer Science**, specialising in **Cybersecurity**. I’m currently studying for my **CompTIA Security+** exam, having recently passed the **CompTIA Network+** certification.  

Alongside my academic work, I’m gaining practical experience through projects that combine **backend development, security principles, and scalable system design**. In my spare time, I enjoy golf and I’m engaged in a range of music activities including singing in choirs and playing piano.
